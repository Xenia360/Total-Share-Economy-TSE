## What is TSE?

The **Total Share Economy (TSE)** is a transdisciplinary proposal to re-engineer economic systems around *human dignity*, *intention*, *ethical circulation*, and *community regeneration*.

It moves away from scarcity-based, extraction-driven capitalism toward a living economic network rooted in presence, contribution, and shared intelligence.

## Core Principles

- **Dignity over domination**
- **Circulation over accumulation**
- **Regeneration over exploitation**
- **Presence and peace as economic assets**
- **Intentional data sharing and consent-based systems**

## Key Concepts

### 1. Return on Intention (RoI)
A new economic metric that measures how aligned your actions are with long-term positive impact.

### 2. Circulation Index
How value flows between people, communities, and systems—not how it is hoarded.

### 3. Dignity Wallet
A decentralized identity/account where your peaceful actions, wisdom, care, and contributions are recorded and rewarded.

## Technologies Behind the Vision

- **Blockchain** for transparency & smart contracts  
- **DAOs** (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) for local self-governance  
- **Ethical AI** trained on consent-based, human-centered data  
- **ZKPs (Zero Knowledge Proofs)** for anonymous trust  
- **Open Data Markets** for community-owned data revenue

## Why TSE Matters

Capitalism is exhausting both people and the planet.  
TSE is not just a critique — it's a **solution**.

By redefining value to include care, creativity, healing, presence, and emotional intelligence, TSE creates space for *everyone* to participate in building peaceful, dignified futures.
